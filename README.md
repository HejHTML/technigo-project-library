# Library

Hi!

I started off by asking ChatGPT about every element, every part in the javascript that I did not understand the function of just by reading and looking at videos. Tried to really get in to which code did what and asked a lot about the filter and sorting. I had a loooong talk about loops and how the looping works and why it was effective to write in a way so that I did not have put all book in again and again.

I got lost in css at first, because it's great to have a nice site to look at. But then I really digged into js. I spent my free time during the week reading and taking all the classes and quiz on js in course. I took the quiz several times. Until I nailed it every time. I want to know that I know - not just get stuck in asking chatGPT everytime I forget. But wow, it's very helpful to ask so you don't get stuck and loose all energy in the process. 
I'm glad I have some previous knowledge in coding, otherwise I would have felt like a cheaty cheater and probably had listened more to chatGPT. Now I'm at least a very irritating boss to it that calls it out when it gets things wrong.

What more could I say about this project? I really liked it. I starts to feel like real websites now. I'm very very excited over the design part. Maybe because it's the easy bits. I don't feel I struggle with html or css, it all makes sense to me. I think I will study UI/UX after this course.

If I did this again, I would have written down a few more js-datatypes, keywords and variables during lessons. Maybe some had stuck more and I did not have to argue so much with chatGPT about them. "What does it do?" "Why do I need this?" "How does it work when my code looks like this?" and a few "can you figure out what I did wrong here?" It is very helpful when AI explains to me in what order to write. Sometimes I have the right code but in the wrong order. 

Happy coding!

Best regards 
Emma
